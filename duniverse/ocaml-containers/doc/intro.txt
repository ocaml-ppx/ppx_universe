{2 Contents}

The design is mostly centered around polymorphism rather than functors. Such
structures comprise (some modules in misc/, some other in core/):

the core library, containers, now depends on base-bytes (provided
by ocamlfind).

{4 Core Modules (extension of the standard library)}

{b findlib name}: containers

{!modules:
CCArray
CCArrayLabels
CCArray_slice
CCBool
CCChar
CCEqual
CCFloat
CCFormat
CCFun
CCHash
CCHashtbl
CCHeap
CCIO
CCInt
CCInt64
CCList
CCListLabels
CCMap
CCOpt
CCOrd
CCPair
CCParse
CCRandom
CCRef
CCResult
CCSet
CCString
CCVector
Containers
}

The module {!Containers} contains aliases to most other modules defined
in {i containers core}, and mixins
such as:

{[ module List = struct
    include List
    include CCList
  end
]}

{4 Containers.data}

{b findlib name}: containers.data

Various data structures.

{!modules:
CCBitField
CCBV
CCCache
CCDeque
CCFQueue
CCFlatHashtbl
CCGraph
CCHashSet
CCHashTrie
CCHet
CCImmutArray
CCIntMap
CCMixmap
CCMixset
CCMixtbl
CCMultiMap
CCMultiSet
CCPersistentArray
CCPersistentHashtbl
CCRAL
CCRingBuffer
CCSimple_queue
CCTrie
CCWBTree
}

{4 Containers.unix}

Helpers that depend on {!Unix}, e.g. to spawn sub-processes.

{!modules: CCUnix}

{4 Containers.sexp}

A small S-expression library. The interface is relatively unstable, but
the main type ([CCSexp.t]) isn't.

{!modules:
CCSexp
}

{4 Containers.iter}

Iterators:

{!modules:
CCKList
CCKTree
CCLazy_list}

{4 String}

containers.string has been removed. Some of its functionality is present
in {!CCString}; some in other libraries such as [Spelll].

{4 Bigarrays}

containers.bigarray has been removed. Use the [Bigstring] library for
arrays of bytes.

{4 Advanced}

containers.advanced has been removed. Use [OLinq] to replace some of its
functionality.

{4 Misc}

Moved to its own repository.

{4 Lwt}

Moved to its own repository

{4 Thread Helpers}

{b findlib name}: containers.thread

Modules related to the use of [Thread].

{!modules:
CCBlockingQueue
CCLock
CCPool
CCSemaphore
CCThread
CCTimer
}
